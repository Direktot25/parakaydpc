  <h1>Congrats sa imong pinning!!</h1>

  <p>I know firsthand how difficult the beginning of the journey was & although I wasn’t present for a majority of whatever hardships you had to get through to get this far, I'm so proud of you!! Kahit na wala sa lugar.</p>

  <p>I’m almost sad I wasn’t there for all of it. But everything happens for a reason nga so. Baka pag nandun ako di ka pala maka-abot pinning. So it’s probably for the better. Doesn’t mean I can’t miss it though hahahha.</p>

  <p>Di ko sure kung naalala mo pero diba I gave u this book na binabasa ko when we started talking palang. Meron quote sa book na I think it sums up how I feel about you:</p>

  <em>“We never really talked much or even looked at each other, but it didn’t matter because we were looking at the same sky together, which is maybe even more intimate than eye contact anyway.”</em>

  <p>I guess what I’m trying to say is that sometimes I’d look at the sky and think of you. About how you’re doing. What you’re thinking about. If you’re having a good time. A hard time maybe.</p>

  <p>And I know it’s not the same as actually having you there—not even close. But it gave me comfort. Knowing that my person was somewhere out there seeing the same sky that I saw. And although we don’t share much with each other anymore, we still had the sky. Have. We’ll always have the same sky.</p>

  <p class="signature">Congrats ulit 🙂 Stay happy always<br><br>– dpc</p>
